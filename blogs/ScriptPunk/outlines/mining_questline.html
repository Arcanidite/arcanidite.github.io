      Onto the mines! After achieving 200 woodcutting, I decided to start a
      blog. Once I settled down after the excitement of hitting my woodcutting
      milestone, I pushed onwards to the Mines of Mantuban! At this point, I
      can't stop pushing cards around. My thoughts at the moment, are leveling
      to 20 in each skill for episode 3. After that, complete the questline and
      reach episode 4.

      I was thinking about what features this site could offer.
      <ul>
        <li>Tips for the UI, or ingame features</li>
        <li>XP efficiency breakadown</li>
        <li>Specific map tool to show information like mining spots etc</li>
        <li>
          interface graphics for the site to indicate content, like Efficient,
          Money making, etc etc
        </li>
      </ul>
      trade sentiments. how to make money with certain skills maybe have a
      tracker for common initial milestones suggestion: when depositing item,
      indicate space remaining graphic, like gray/black dots for occurpied space
